				<h1>Your Impact</h1>
                <p></p>
                <p>Oh god, where do I start?</p>
                <p>Have you ever heard of Chaos Theory?</p>
                <p>One popular interpretation of Chaos Theory is the Butteryfly Effect. That's where people think that a butterfly flapping its wings on one side of the planet can cause hurricanes on the other.</p>
                <p>Your impact in my life has been sort of like that, but not in a chaotic or bad way. It's hard to tell you exactly what impact you've had because there's been so much over such a long period that I definitely wouldn't be who I am today if it weren't for you.</p>
                <p>I remember that for the longest time I had you mixed up with Bella Parini. It didn't help that you both dated Andrew too.</p>
                <p>To be honest, I always thought you were a bit too cool to be hanging out with me or dealing with me. I'm not entirely certain where that changed, but I'm glad it did.</p>
                <p>You dealt with a lot of my crap (mostly stuff involving Kim) and I'm eternally thankful for that. Most importantly though, you've always pushed me to the best person I possibly can and I can't thank you enough for that.</p>
                <p>You've been a refreshing constant in my life for the last few years. It's great to always have someone there for you that you can depend on to help you through the hard times. Sometimes I get the feeling that you don't truly understand how important you are to me. I know a lot of people say that about a lot of things, but I genuinely mean it. I often find that I ask myself "What would Becca think of me doing this?" before I do a lot of the things I do.</p>
                <p>It's been tough being this far away from you. I think I've seen you maybe 3 or 4 times in the last two years? That's rough. I never really understood the impact that you had on my life until you weren't a constant part of it. It's like there's a small hole that I can't fill. Its tough for me to not constantly bug you to talk to me, but I know you're busy and have other things going on. It just makes the times when I can see you that much better.</p>
                <p>I can't really imagine what life without you would be like. I know that no matter what happens, I'll always be there for you. I know you'll do your best to always be there for me too, no matter what.</p>
                <p>But I digress, I'm supposed to be talking about how you've impacted me. I think you know how you've impacted me though. You know how important you are to me. You've been there through my good and bad parts and have advised me through a lot of things. You know deep down that I wouldn't be who I am today or where I am today if I didn't have you, even if you won't admit that to yourself. You've been an amazing force for good in my life and I hope that never changes. I love you and everything you've done for me Becca.</p>
