				<h1>LETTERS</h1>
				<img src="images/us.jpg" alt="">
				<h1>Overview</h1>
				<p>I haven't been the best about sending you letters. Hopefully this section makes up for that a little bit. This section has a bunch of stuff that I want to say to you but haven't found the time. Don't worry though, I'll still send physical letters.</p>
				<h1>Letter 1 - Imposter Syndrome</h1>
				<p>I know that lately you've felt like an imposter. Believe me, it's hard to get rid of that feeling. When you go to school with and are constantly surrounded by exceptional people then it makes it really difficult to see your own worth. I want you to know that it's completely bogus. Take it from me, someone who experiences that on a daily basis and to a degree that not a lot of lowly kids from Butte ever experience. It's tough. It's hard not being the smartest person in the room, not knowing anything about what's being talked about in groups, and it's especially hard just not knowing something everyone else seems to think is simple. When it comes down to it, you're not made any less because of what you don't know. In fact, I think it makes us better. You have a sense of what you do and don't understand and the things you don't understand bug you. That drive is only going to make you smarter and more successful. I'm certain that you're smart enough to accomplish anything. Few people can do the things you do or experience the things you've done and it wasn't a fluke that all that happened to you. All the progress and achievement you've had in life is solely due to you. You didn't fool your way into your research position or into anywhere else for that matter. You just aren't seeing what you're truly capable of, but you will. Just don't give up until then.</p>
				<p>I believe in you.</p>
                <h1>Letter 2 - The Inferior Sex</h1>
                <p>It feels a bit cliche to say that guys suck, but they do. Guys our age are in a weird state (as if they're never in a weird state.) Trust me, I know. They're just old enough to be away from their parents without supervision and when you combine that with a nearly unlimited supply of alcohol, well, nothing good happens. If you want my opinion, I'm not a fan of guys my age. The majority of guys seem to fall into two categories: the shy recluse who actively works towards avoiding social interaction and the Brads/Chads that are social animals and destroy tables and walls while drunk for a good laugh. Naturally, you want someone in the middle. Someone who is outgoing enough to have good opinions on things and a voice to speak them, but that isn't constantly pushing his opinion on others. The middle ground is a good place to date guys from, but I'm not sure how many guys are actually in that category. Even guys like Bissem or I have weird quirks about us that make us far from perfect.</p>
                <p>The worst part of it all is trying to find someone that you mesh with. There's so many guys out there that your odds of finding the wrong guy or having a bad relationship are exponentially higher than your odds of finding the right guy. The worst thing you can do though is give up. Never for a minute let yourself think that you're better off alone or that you're never going to find someone. People much less deserving than you find happiness, so you will too. I know that the idea of potentially ending up alone is very scary. I rarely tell people, but I'm very scared of it too. Every couple I see reminds me of the possibility that I never find someone. I feel like it's sort-of socially unacceptable for guys to show emotion or to be worried about that sort of thing, but I am. It feels like everything that I accomplish in my life will be lesser if I don't have someone to share those accomplishments with and that scares the shit out of me. </p>
                <p>You've tossed around the idea of that pact between us and I still aren't certain of whether or not you're being serious. I'm all in support of it, but if we are being honest, I have one major problem with it. If you are serious and it's something we agree on, I feel like I would purposely sabatoge my chances of finding someone so that I could potentially be with you. Which is in no way a bad outcome, but it banks entirely on you not finding someone also and I want you to find someone. I want you to find someone infinitely better than me. Someone that you mesh with so well that you couldn't imagine life without them. I know that person is out there. I know you'll find them. I'll always be there for you and I'll be equally happy if the pact kicks in and we end up together or if you find someone amazing. I know I did a poor job explaining this. It's difficult to explain and I'm always open for answering any questions you have. Don't give up Becca, I know someone is out there for you, whether you've met them already or not. </p>
				<h1>Letter 3 - You in My Life</h1>
                <p>It's really hard for me to describe how much you mean to me and how important you are. You're one of those things that has always been there and always will be. The impact that you have on my life is massive. You're one of those things that is always there when I need it without fail and it's really hard to imagine you not being there. I try and talk about this a little more elsewhere on the site, so I won't repeat a lot of that here, you'll find that other stuff eventually.</p>
                <p>You need to know though that I'm always here for you, no matter what. A lot of people say that in life and I'm sure I'm not the only one that has said that to you, but I want to be one of the ones that truly means it. I want to be someone you can always count on and confide in. I want to be better than the other people in your life that have let you down at some point or another. I want to be a constant in your life, regardless of what happens. You mean the world to me and I don't want to miss any of your life and I want you to be a part of mine.</p>
                <p>This website has taken me a while. I've been working on it on and off all semester. It's changed shape, design, and layout multiple times. I thought it would be something cool and novel that nobody else has ever done for you. I don't think I say anything here that I haven't already told you before, but I like having it all in one place for you to see and read anytime you want. I'll keep the website up pretty much permanently. If I ever make any changes to it I will let you know. Essentially, I'm trying to show you how important you are to me with this website. Sometimes I regret not living closer to you. I can't show up at your house with flowers or come over when you're feeling sad. I know a website is a poor substitute for that, but I hope it means something. It'll be a little more permanent than flowers at least.</p>
                <p>I really miss you Becca. It sucks not seeing you every day or talking to you every day. Some times I sit here and look at plane tickets and wonder how realistic it would be for me to fly back to Montana for a visit. I regret that I'm not as big of a part of your life as I have been in the past. I don't think it's always going to be like this though. We will live closer to each other again one day and I'll more than make up for all this lost time when that happens.</p>
                <h1>Letter 4 - The Future</h1>
                <p>To be honest, I have no idea what the future has in store. Obviously there are things that I want to happen. Fate seldom seems to take our desires into account though when it decides what to do with us. Naturally we have some sway over what happens, but in the end I feel like everything that has led to where I am currently has been one unseen event after another. In seventh grade I didn’t expect to be going to school in New York to be a rocket scientist. The path that led from there to where I am now was totally unpredictable and I can’t help feel like that is how the future is going to pan out also.</p>
                <p>Sure, I have a general idea of what I want to do and I’m certain that you do to. Years of planning and preparation can be undone or changed in an instant though. A breakup, meeting someone new, a random flyer, or even some random text can completely derail everything that has taken years of planning and the change can be for better or for worse. I feel like I’m being pretty bleak and I’m partially going to blame that on the late hour that I’m writing this at (it’s 3 am I think.) It’s also partially due to my outlook lately, but that’s a topic for another time.</p>
                <p>At the end of the day, all we can do is try our best. We have goals we want to achieve and any number of things can ruin our pursuit of those goals. Since we don’t know what’s going to ruin what and when it’s going to happen: all we can do is keep pursuing those goals. I know that somedays you feel like you’re not smart enough to accomplish what you want or that you’re scared that you’ll be alone. I get that. I feel the exact same and I’m sure that a lot of other people do too. I want you to know though that I believe in you and your abilities. You’re not one to easily give up or to let yourself under-achieve on your goals. Even though the future is crazy and unpredictable, I know that you have the skills, motivation, and smarts to make sure that you achieve all your goals, regardless of whatever fate throws at you.</p>
                <p>I know what I see in you is true. I think that once you see it too that all your doubts about yourself will disappear.</p>
