				<h1>Places to Visit</h1>
				<img src="images/US_Map.png" alt="" />
				<h3><span>I know you love to travel and experience new things, especially nature. I for one really love some of the photos you've taken in scenic places. This section is a list of the top 10 places I would love to visit with you. I chose places that have amazing natural attractions that I think you would love. They're pinpointed on the map and links and descriptions are below. They're in no particular order.</span></h3>
				<h1>1. Angel's Landing, Utah</h1>
                <img src="images/1.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>This is supposedly one of the best hikes in Utah. It's only 2.4 miles long, but it's crazy steep. The views are apparently AMAZING.</p>

                <h1>2. Honopu Beach, Hawaii</h1>
                <img src="images/2.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>This one doesn't need much explanation. It's a remote beach on one of Hawaii's islands. I've heard its amazing, but isn't all of Hawaii?</p>
                <p><a href="http://www.unrealhawaii.com/2015/09/honopu-beach/">Honopu Beach</a></p>
                <h1>3. Multnomah Falls, Oregon</h1>
                <img src="images/3.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>This is a two step waterfall near Portland. It's the largest waterfall in Oregon.</p>

                <h1>4. Great Sand Dunes National Park, Colorado</h1>
                <img src="images/4.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>Located near some of the tallest mountains in Colorado, these sand dunes are some of the highest sand dunes in North America.</p>

                <h1>5. Horshoe Bend, Colorado River, Arizona</h1>
                <img src="images/5.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>The Colorado River is massive, but near the Utah and Arizona border it bends back in a horshoe shape that looks phenominal.</p>

                <h1>6. Carlsbad Cavern, New Mexico</h1>
                <img src="images/6.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>These caves are part of a system of over 100 limestone caves buried beneath a desert in New Mexico.</p>

                <h1>7. Hamilton Pool, Texas</h1>
                <img src="images/7.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>This one is close to Austin. These pools are supposedly awesome swimming spots that were created thousands of years ago when the dome of an undergroud river caved in.</p>

                <h1>8. Watkings Glen, New York</h1>
                <img src="images/8.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>This one is kinda close to me. These are a series of 19 waterfalls that all occur within a single gorge within the space of 2 miles.</p>
                <p><a href="https://parks.ny.gov/parks/142/">Watkins Glen</a></p>

                <h1>9. Lake Tahoe, California</h1>
                <img src="images/9.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>Lake Tahoe supposedly has ridiculously clear water. To top it off, the lake is bordered by the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Sounds like an awesome place to be.</p>

                <h1>10. Glacier</h1>
                <img src="images/10.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>Glacier is kinda a freebie. I've yet to go here with you. I would absolutely love to go with you, even if we've both been before.</p>
